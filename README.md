The multithreaded web server is designed to handle multiple client requests concurrently, efficiently managing incoming HTTP requests and serving static resources like HTML files or images. This project demonstrates core concepts of networking, multithreading, and socket programming in Java, as well as HTTP protocol handling.

Developed a high-performance multithreaded web server in Java, boosting request-handling efficiency by
50% compared to single-threaded implementations.
Optimized server concurrency through efficient thread management, enabling the system to handle up to 5,000
simultaneous client connections.
